        <h2>About Animals!</h2>
        <p>Animals are simply defined as multicellular, eukaryotic, aerobic organisms which feed on plants and other
            animals as their source of food. All these animals reproduce sexually and live freely in habitat.
            Altogether, there are two to three millions of animal species and are grouped into the Animal kingdom, which
            is the largest and most diverse group among the five kingdoms of biological classifications. Based on their
            similarities, characteristic features, and genetic analysis, animals are grouped into Kingdom Animalia.

            In order to study the different types of animals along with their features, taxonomists grouped all animals
            into Kingdom Animalia, which is further divided into divisions and subdivisions.</p>
